        next Education Officer!

    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>
      I firmly believe in the prosperous future of our university and its students, 
      building a beneficial foundation that supports learners from all backgrounds. 
      As your Education Officer, I will work diligently to ensure everyoneâ€™s voice is heard 
      and that we all enjoy a richer academic experience.

    <h3>Free Wednesday Afternoons</h3><br>
    <p>
      I will push to free Wednesday afternoons from the timetabled day for students, 
      societies, and BUCS alike. This provides crucial time for extracurricular activities, 
      sports, and social engagement.
      Believe it or not, there was once a time where the later half of a Wednesday was completely
      free from Lectures, Workshops, Labs and seminars alike. Students could relax, study or play 
      and most importantly, sporting socieites (including BUCS) had the chance to get some proper practice
      during those daylight hours.
    </p>

    <span id="read"></span><span id="more">
      <p>
          However, as the years have gone on this free time has dwindled and now more than ever do I hear
          students wanting it back. Previous education officers have made considerable
          progress on achieving this and I believe I can continue this journey and secure our
          Wednesday afternoons once again.
      </p>
      <p>
        But why Wednesday?
      </p>
      <p>If you haven't had free Wednesdays do not worry. Let me break it down. <br>
        Like with any University course. It is intensive, physically and mentally draining.
        Being one of the top 10 unis, we strive to keep our reputation. Always. So to keep our
        standard, a midweek break is brilliant to refresh the mind and keep you fresh. <br><br>
        Studies have proven that even in the working world, a midweek break even for a few hours
        boosts our mental health. And as societies and sports are key to your life in uni this time
        off would prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Funnily enough, it is an academic policy of the uni and the union to keep Wednesday afternoons free (post 1pm)
        from teaching and recently up to 25% of student report having some form of scheudles class during this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        These afternoons are more than just a midweek break. They prove to us how challenging Uni life is and giving
        us time to unwind will encourage healthier lifestyles and personal growth. And be ready for that night out
        or Thursday 9am of course ðŸ˜‰

    <h3>More Careers Fairs</h3><br>
    <p>
      Have you ever found yourself wandering into the flagship autumn careers fair or
      one of the smaller departmental fairs either to have a look around or wanting
      crucial questions answered by the top employing companies only to walk away with
      little information or the companies not having any roles available at that time of year?
    </p>
    <span id="read2"></span><span id="more2">     
      <p>
        Without a doubt the careers fairs are one of the most important events a student can attend
        at Lancaster. However, for too long now have I noticed dissapointment when looking for a graduate
        scheme only for them to be closed or closing by the time the fairs come around. Even worse as final
        year students who want a job after graduation!
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that all students in all years should be given plenty of oppertunity to discover, question
        and apply to a variety of schemes and although it is out of my and the unis power to change employer deadlines.
        I do trust we cant work around the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        As your Education Officer I will work with the student union and university to split the big careers fairs
        into smaller more spread out fairs that span across the year. My main reason for this is to allow smaller companies
        to sell themselves to students along side the big leagues of the employer world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only this, I strongly believe that this oppertunity will allow students to become much more aware
        of the process of life post-graduation. With smaller flagship fairs across the year, students who are
        going into their final year will have the knowledge of how and when to apply long before those deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what do I mean by this?
        <p>
          Imagine you are going into your final third year at Lancaster, if we had a couple flagship fairs
          at the beginning of that year when you were in second year, you would understand and be ready on
          deadlines and when to apply long before you enter third year. Now how much easier would that be.
          Less stress for sure.

  <section id="point3" class="point-section">
    <h3>Strengthen Student-Rep & Department Links</h3><br>
    <p>
      As students, your feedback and concerns for your courses are what shapes your experience.
      You may or may not be aware of student reps who take this feedback and relay it onto your departmental
      leads or faculty reps. The almost middle man role of being a rep is one of the most important roles
      in any department as who better to know arising issues than the students themselves!
    </p>
    <span id="read3"></span><span id="more3">
      <p>
        However, answer me this. When was the last time you spoke to your course rep? or do you know who your reps are?
        If the answers are no then do not fear. Since being a previous student rep myself, I have noticed the true
        difficulty sometimes of having a steady flow of information from you to our departments. Almost as if there is 
        a broken bond somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, I am striving to secure and improve the relationship between student reps and students between them and departments
        allowing for much more transparency, trustworthy feedback loops and valuable results. Student reps already get high class
        training from the student union but there is always room for improvement in all aspects. So I believe I can work with LUSU
        to deliver a more optimal approach allowing for reps of all departments to share ideas university wide and become more engaged
        with their classmates. Ultimately ensuring a greater department to student relationship on all fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Who knows! There may be issues arising in LUMS that may prove beneficial to FST once fixed!

  <!-- Additional / Lesser Points -->

    <h3>Additional Goals Iâ€™m Committed To</h3>
    <p>
      On top of the big three, I have some smaller but still important goals I wish to address
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keeping tabs on the <strong>ever-changing landscape</strong> of the ethical and 
        educational use of Artificial Intelligence.
      </li>
      <br>
      <p>
        AI in education is more prevalent than ever and the line in where it can and can't be used
        is incredibly blured. I wish to address this with a real solution that'll be beneficial to all
        parties involved.
      </p>
      <li>
        <strong>Boosting representation</strong> of postgraduate students and ensuring 
        they have a strong voice in university decisions.
      </li>
      <br>
      <p>
        Post grads are still students and I believe they should be treated the same as any other
        student in a way that gives them the same oppertunities as undergraduates.
      </p>
      <li>
        Promoting <strong>full transparency</strong> between departments and their students, 
        so everyone knows exactly whatâ€™s happening and why.
      </li>
      <br>
      <p>
        Sometimes, decisions are made which aren't addressed to students properly or have detailed
        description. I believe as not only a student but as adults, we should be entitled to full details
        and changes occuring in departments (of course within reason).
      </p>
      <li>
        Actively working to <strong>improve and assist climate & sustainability</strong> 
        goals across Lancaster University.
      </li>
      <br>
      <p>
        The climate goal of the University is well underway and already showing great progress.
        I wish to continue working with the union and promote greater awareness in education about
        world issues.
      </p>
